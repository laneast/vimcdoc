### Internal notes

To make sure the HTML pages in gh-pages are updated every time you update help
files, use `devel/tools/checkin.sh` while you are in the master branch. The
script will commit the changes in the master branch as well as updating the
corresponding HTML pages in gh-pages automatically.
